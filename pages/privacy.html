      <h2>2. Overview of processing</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains what personal data is processed when you use Quizly and for what
        purpose. “Personal data” means any information that can be related to you (e.g., name, email
        address, IP address).
      </p>

      <h2>3. Hosting and server log files</h2>
      <p>
        When you access this website/app, the hosting provider and/or server automatically processes
        information in so-called server log files. This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Date and time of the request</li>
        <li>Requested page / URL</li>
        <li>HTTP status code</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Browser type and version / operating system</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> ensuring technical stability, security (e.g., defense against attacks),
        and troubleshooting.<br />
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests).<br />
        <strong>Retention:</strong> log data is stored only as long as necessary for security and
        troubleshooting and is then deleted or anonymized, unless legal obligations require longer
        retention.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Account, authentication and use of the app</h2>
      <p>
        If Quizly provides user accounts (e.g., login), we process the data required to create and manage
        your account and to provide the app’s features. Depending on the implementation, this may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Account data (e.g., username, email address)</li>
        <li>Authentication data (e.g., password hash, tokens/sessions)</li>
        <li>App content you create within Quizly (e.g., quizzes, questions, answers)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> providing the service, login, security, preventing misuse, and fulfilling
        requested features.<br />
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of a contract / pre-contractual measures)
        and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (security, prevention of abuse).<br /><br />
        <strong>Important:</strong> Passwords are not stored in plain text. They are stored only in a secure,
        hashed form.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you contact us (e.g., by email), we process the data you provide (e.g., name, email address and
        message) to handle your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (if related to a contract/service) or Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR
        (legitimate interest in responding).<br />
        <strong>Retention:</strong> data is deleted once your request has been fully processed, unless legal
        obligations require longer retention.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Cookies and tracking</h2>
      <p>
        This website/app does not use tracking technologies for advertising purposes (e.g., third-party ad tracking).
        If technically necessary cookies or local storage are used (e.g., for keeping you logged in), they are used
        solely to provide the requested functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in providing a functional and secure
        service)
        and, where applicable, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (service provision).
      </p>
      <p>
        If analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) or marketing tools are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will
        be updated accordingly and, if required, consent will be obtained.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data recipients and third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        We only share personal data if it is necessary to operate this website/app, if there is a legal obligation, or
        if
        you have consented.
      </p>
      <p>Typical recipients may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting provider / infrastructure service providers (for operating servers and databases)</li>
        <li>IT service providers involved in maintenance and security (only if necessary)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data transfers to countries outside the EU/EEA may occur only if legally permitted and protected by appropriate
        safeguards (e.g., EU standard contractual clauses), where required.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We store personal data only as long as necessary for the respective purpose or as required by law.
        Account-related
        data is generally retained for the duration of your account. You can request deletion where applicable (see your
        rights below).
      </p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data (e.g., encryption via
        HTTPS/TLS,
        access controls, and security updates). Nevertheless, no method of transmission over the internet is 100%
        secure.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. The current version is
        always
        available on this page.
